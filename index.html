<p>Project Description:</p>
<p>Creature Conquest is a 3D tower defense video game developed in the Unity game engine.
    The game aims to put a new spin on the widely popular tower defense genre by introducing roguelike elements such as permadeath and progression.
    Players embark on ‘runs’ where they attempt a series of levels.
    Win or lose, players unlock new towers and upgrades that can be utilized on subsequent runs.</p>
